    The first Yenat Guada (Momâ€™s Kitchen) opened its door in the mid 70's in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A childhood spent mostly enjoying traditionally prepared Ethiopian dishes and exploring inside the family run old fashioned Ethiopian restaurant, it became our unsuppressed dream to continue the rich family tradition abroad. Now the dream has come to be a reality, we are determined to keep the authentic flavorful taste of every Ethiopian dish that comes out of the kitchen and make you feel right at.
